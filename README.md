# ham-shuati(刷题)
Chinese Mainland HAM radio Class-A Certificate of Operation exam practice helper

Just run `shuati.py`, it will randomly select 30 questions from the question-base and initiate a practice exam.

When you finish the 30-question practice exam, your exam result and report will be dumped in `./做题记录`, review your wrong answers, correct them in your mind, and get higher scores!

May you get your certificate soon so we can get in touch via HAM radio! Best wishes with a 73!
